- **Clone the Repository:** Use the git clone command followed by the URL of the repository.  See below:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/timyers/MotifFindR
```
- `MotifFindR` uses the `R` package [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to create a reproducible environment.  It records the exact package versions `MotifFindR` depends on and ensures those exact versions get installed.

- After installation, when you open the project `renv` should automatically bootstrap iteself, downloading and installing the appropriate version of `renv`.  It should also ask if you want to download and install all the packages `MotifFindR` needs by running `renv::restore()`.
